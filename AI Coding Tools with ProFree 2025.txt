### AI Coding Tools with Pro/Free Trials in 2025

Based on a comprehensive search across web sources and X discussions (including Grok community recommendations), here's a curated list of AI tools that offer pro-level features with free trials or forever-free plans. These tools support coding, refactoring, pair programming, code design improvement, debugging, and related tasks. I've focused on those explicitly mentioned with trial options, prioritizing relevance to your query. Tools are grouped by primary focus, with details on trial length, key features, and pricing notes where available.

Note: Availability can change; always check official sites for the latest. Many tools offer student discounts or referral credits as alternatives to trials.

#### Grok-Specific Insights from X Community
In Grok discussions on X, users frequently recommend integrating Grok (e.g., Grok Code Fast) with tools like Cursor or Cline for free/subsidized coding trials. Grok 4 itself is subscription-based (via SuperGrok or Premium+), but offers extended free trials periodically (e.g., until Sept 2025 in some posts). It's praised for research, explanations, and fast coding, often paired with Claude for refactoring/design. No standalone "pro trial" for Grok, but API access starts at low costs for developers.
